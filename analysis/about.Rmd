This is a large single nuclei RNA-seq dataset from Evangelyn Sim and Enzo Porrello from the Heart Regeneration group at MCRI. The samples were prepared by Evangelyn Sim and the data was processed and sequenced at the Translational Genomics Unit at MCRI.

This analysis will focus on data from the left ventricle. There are multiple biological replicates from three groups: fetal (n=3), child (n=3), adult (n=3). We are interested in understanding the differences in the composition of the hearts at the different ages and 
differences in sex. Specifically we will perform differential expression analysis between groups within cell types and examine changes in cell type composition.
