Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I tried a number of approaches to integrate the data and used the distribution of the cells from the fetal sample replicates across the clusters to determine how successful the integration was across samples. I also examined sex and batch as additional covariates.</p>
<p>I settled on the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove mitochondrial, ribosomal and genes with no annotation</li>
<li>Gene filtering of lowly expressed genes assuming min cluster size of 20</li>
<li>Remove genes on X and Y chromosome so they are not selected to perform clustering</li>
<li>Use SCTransform to normalise the data <em>without</em> including additional covariates</li>
<li>Perform data integration across biological replicates
<ul>
<li>Use 30 CCA dimensions</li>
<li>Use 3000 anchor features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scale data</li>
<li>Run principle components analysis</li>
<li>Perform clustering
<ul>
<li>Use 20 CCA dimensions</li>
<li>Resolution = 0.3 for marker analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visualisation with TSNE and clustree</li>
<li>Marker analysis</li>
</ul>

<h1>Try new normalisation method: SCTransform</h1>
<p>This new method replaces the <code>NormalizeData</code>, <code>FindVariableFeatures</code> and <code>ScaleData</code> functions. It performs regularised negative binomial regression with the total sequencing depth per cell as the covariate (i.e. library size), as well as any other user supplied covariates. The Pearson residuals are then used in downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Upon further reading, it is not clear that this is compatible with the integration method in Seurat (future work by the Seurat team). The method is slower than previous functions but not prohibitively so (~10 minutes for the fetal dataset of 27760 cells).</p>
<p>Although this method isn’t fully compatible with the integration approach, it seemed to contribute to giving the ``best&quot; clustering results following data integration of the three samples.</p>

http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
